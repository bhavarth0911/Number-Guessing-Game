A number guessing game in Java is a simple console-based application where the program randomly selects a number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), 
and the player tries to guess the number. The program provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. 
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. This type of game typically involves concepts such as random number generation, user input handling, conditional statements, and loops.
